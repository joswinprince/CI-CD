# CI-CD

## Definition
- continuous integration and continuous deployment 
- CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. 
- CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation. 
- By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle, organizations are able to develop higher quality code, faster.

*** Objectives
1. Bringing developers and IT operations teams together to deploy software. 
2. Tools that are included in the pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and binaries creation.
3.  For containerized environments, this pipeline would also include packaging the code into a container image to be deployed across a hybrid cloud.
